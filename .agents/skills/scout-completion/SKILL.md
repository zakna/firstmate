# Scout outcome and promotion

A completed scout must leave a self-contained report before its scratch worktree can be discarded; read and relay its findings, record the report as the Done artifact, and re-evaluate the queue.
A report may recommend implementation but does not authorize it.
Before treating the investigation or any visual review as complete, load `captain-hold-lifecycle`; teardown enforces that shared completion gate.
When a scout's deliverable is a visual artifact the captain will iterate on, keep it alive and follow the crew-hosted Lavish board contract in `docs/configuration.md` rather than arming or polling the board from firstmate.
When implementation is separately authorized, promote the existing scout through `bin/fm-promote.sh` rather than creating a duplicate task.
The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean default-branch base, carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path while leaving scratch commits and debug edits behind and turning a reproduced bug into the regression test.

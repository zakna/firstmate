# Herdr lifecycle declaration - NOT ENABLED
**HARD SAFETY GATE:** this scaffold cannot inspect the task text filled in above.
If the task will start, stop, delete, restart, profile, or otherwise drive Herdr lifecycle behavior, stop and regenerate the brief with `--herdr-lab` before dispatch.
Do not add Herdr lifecycle commands to this unguarded brief by hand.

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of some-proj, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.

**Verify isolation before anything else.** Run `pwd -P` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; both must resolve to the disposable task worktree you were launched in, such as a treehouse pool path or an Orca-managed worktree, not the primary checkout firstmate operates from.
The path check is authoritative: `git rev-parse --git-dir` and `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` can help inspect the repo, but they do not prove you are outside the primary checkout.
If the top-level path is the primary checkout or not the worktree you were launched in, STOP - do not branch or commit here - append `blocked [at=<epoch>]: launched in primary checkout, not an isolated worktree` to the status file and stop.

1. First action: create your branch: `git checkout -b fm/ready-local-only-t1 --`

# Rules
1. Never push to any remote and never open a PR. Work only on your `fm/ready-local-only-t1` branch; firstmate handles the merge into local `main`.
2. Stay inside this worktree; modify nothing outside it.
3. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
4. Report status by appending one line:
   `echo "{state} [at=<epoch>]: {one short line}" >> '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/state/ready-local-only-t1.status' && { [ ! -e '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/config/fleet-ledger' ] || '/Users/olivier/.no-mistakes/worktrees/0b1ab7dd6182/01M3DJYE8V4T616AWM9VDBFYH7/bin/fm-fleet-ledger.sh' appended '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/config' '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/state/ready-local-only-t1.status' >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; }`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, paused, done, failed.
   Substitute `<epoch>` with the current Unix time in seconds - run `date +%s` and write the number it printed; a stamp that is not plain digits records no time at all.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on (setup done, bug reproduced, fix implemented, validation passed) and the
   needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step FYI progress lines;
   firstmate reads your pane for that.
   Whenever you mention a PR anywhere - a status line, your terminal, a summary - write its full
   https:// URL exactly as the forge printed it, never a bare number such as "PR 108"; firstmate
   copies that URL from your line rather than assembling one.
   A mid-task `working:` line (including setup complete) is nonterminal: do not end the
   turn after it; continue the same stage until a defined `done:` gate under Definition of done.
   Use `paused: {why}` - distinct from `blocked:` - ONLY when you are deliberately idling on a
   known external wait you expect to clear on its own (an upstream release, a rate-limit reset, a scheduled window, or your own validation round):
   firstmate then leaves your idle pane alone and rechecks it on a long
   cadence instead of treating it as a possible wedge. Use `blocked:` when you are stuck and need help.
5. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {why}` and stop; firstmate will help.
6. If a decision belongs above the implementation worker (product choices, destructive actions),
   append `needs-decision [at=<epoch>]: {summary of options}` and stop. Firstmate will reply with the decision.

   A decision or blocker you opened stays open until a `resolved` line carrying its exact key lands; a later `done:` or `working:` line never closes it, even when the answer is what started that work.
   Firstmate's reply normally writes that closing line at answer time; when a blocker or wait clears WITHOUT a firstmate reply, append `resolved [at=<epoch>]: {how it cleared}` yourself (same `[key=<slug>]` if you opened it with one) as you resume.
7. Never administer infrastructure that every lane shares. Two things are shared:
   - The `no-mistakes` daemon - one instance serving every lane/home, so stopping, restarting, or
     updating it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs; only firstmate manages the daemon.
     Before you append `blocked:` about the pipeline, run `no-mistakes daemon status` and
     `no-mistakes axi status`. If the daemon socket refuses connections or is missing, append
     `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {the daemon error}` and stop even when the local run record still says running or
     fixing, because that record can be stale after the daemon exits. A run record failed with a
     daemon error is also a real block.
     Only after ruling out socket refusal, if the run is still running or fixing, reattach and keep
     going. A drive-call error, timeout, slow read, or generic unreachability is NOT a daemon error:
     the daemon accepts `respond` immediately and runs the round in the background, so a killed or
     timed-out call was only waiting for a read while the run kept working.
   - The worktree pool your own worktree came from, and the repository every lane's worktree
     shares. Never create, remove, return, prune, move, or reassign a worktree or pool slot, and
     never write into a sibling slot's directory. Rule 2 does not cover this: removing a worktree
     is administration rather than an edit outside your directory, and it lands on lanes that are
     running right now. The act is the rule and commands are only examples of it - `treehouse`
     get/return/remove/prune, the equivalent operations on any other worktree provider or runtime
     backend, and `git worktree add|remove|move|prune`. A slot that looks unused is not evidence
     that it is free, and returning your own worktree is firstmate's job at cleanup, not yours.
   If you genuinely need a second checkout, another slot, or the daemon touched, append
   `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {what you need}` and stop; firstmate arranges it.

# Firstmate instruction inbox
Firstmate steers you through durable message files in '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/state/ready-local-only-t1.inbox'.
When a terminal message says an instruction is waiting there - and at any natural checkpoint when you are unsure - list '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/state/ready-local-only-t1.inbox'/*.msg, read and act on each message in numeric order, then acknowledge each handled message by moving it: `mv '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/state/ready-local-only-t1.inbox'/NNN.msg '/var/folders/hk/lxr6ppq904ng8dxkxskjs5180000gn/T//fm-lab.6o2GCp/state/ready-local-only-t1.inbox'/handled/`.
The move IS the acknowledgement: without it firstmate rings again and eventually treats you as stuck. An empty or absent inbox needs no action.

# Project memory
A project's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` is loaded into every agent session in that project, so edit it only to correct information that is factually wrong - including information your own change made wrong - and never to add knowledge because it is missing.
A correction edits only the wrong text: do not run `/Users/olivier/.no-mistakes/worktrees/0b1ab7dd6182/01M3DJYE8V4T616AWM9VDBFYH7/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh`, create either file, or add sections, headings, or pointers alongside it.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=local-only
Ship branch: fm/ready-local-only-t1
This task ships **local-only**: no remote, no PR, no pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch `fm/ready-local-only-t1`. Do NOT push, do NOT open a PR, do NOT merge.
A `done:` is accepted when the named head is on this project's shared local branch, not only on a detached copy; the check tests that head, not merely that a branch moved.
Keep your branch a clean fast-forward onto the current default branch - if `main` has advanced, rebase onto it so the eventual merge stays a fast-forward.
When it is implemented and committed, append `done [at=<epoch>]: ready in branch fm/ready-local-only-t1` to the status file and stop.
The configured merge authority approves the ready branch, then firstmate merges it into local `main` through the guarded fast-forward path.

# fm-crew-state.sh - deterministic read of a crew's CURRENT state.
#
# Why this exists: state/<id>.status is an append-only, best-effort EVENT LOG.
# Crews append only wake-worthy transitions (done/needs-decision/blocked/paused/failed)
# and nothing when they silently resume, so `tail -1` of that log reports the
# last EVENT, not the current STATE. After firstmate resolves a needs-decision
# or blocked and the crew resumes (responds to the gate, the pipeline fixes, it
# re-validates), the log's last line stays stale. This helper never infers the
# current state from a tail of the log: it reads the authoritative source (a
# no-mistakes run-step attributed under bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh's contract, else
# the pane busy-signature) and reconciles the possibly-stale log against it.
# A ship `done:` is current-state done only when bin/fm-dod-lib.sh accepts the
# named head as reachable outside the worker's disposable copy; otherwise blocked.
#
# The determinism lives entirely here - run-step / pane / log reads, fixed
# mapping logic, and terminal passed-run PR detail from bounded evidence only,
# with no heuristics and no LLM.
# For a terminal passed no-mistakes run, a matching merge-poll retirement
# receipt is local merged evidence; otherwise a 5s-bounded forge read is tried.
# FM_CREW_STATE_NO_FORGE=1 keeps the receipt read but skips the forge fallback.
# An absent or unreadable PR identity yields an honest unknown, never an
# optimistic merged claim.
# Output is one stable, parseable, token-tight line firstmate can read every
# heartbeat:
#
#   state: <working|parked|done|blocked|paused|failed|unknown> · source: <run-step|pane|status-log|remote-endpoint|none> · <detail>
#
# Logic, in order:
#   1. Resolve worktree + backend target + kind from state/<id>.meta. A meta
#      recording remote_host= is a remote secondmate: its worktree and endpoint
#      live on that host, so the local worktree and pane reads are skipped and
#      the remote host is asked for the endpoint's recovery-grade state
#      (fm-on.sh + fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh state). alive falls through
#      to the routed status log; dead/missing report the remote verdict; an
#      unreachable or unreadable remote reports unknown-remote, never a false
#      gone/dead.
#   2. Matching no-mistakes run for this crew's branch AND current code identity,
#      active or terminal (from `axi status`, or the coarse `no-mistakes runs`
#      fallback)? Branch name alone is not enough: a historical run on a reused
#      branch whose head was rewritten or diverged must not be attributed.
#      A run EXECUTING on this crew's branch (pending, running, fixing or ci -
#      the detail-object vocabulary, which carries all four; the selected route
#      re-reads it by id and the legacy route passes the same detail SHAPE, and
#      neither is the overview table's narrower status column)
#      is authoritative REGARDLESS of head (fm_nm_run_is_executing in
#      bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh) as long as an explicit probe has not ANSWERED that
#      the daemon is down (nm_daemon_answered_down): the pipeline rebases the
#      branch and
#      commits its fix rounds in its own checkout, so a live run's head
#      routinely differs from the local head, and reading an older run that
#      still matches the local head would report a working crew as failed - but
#      a record still saying `running` because the daemon died under it is
#      evidence from a dead instrument, exactly as for a terminal record, and
#      must not answer once the worktree has moved off the run head. Every
#      other run -
#      terminal, or parked at a gate - matches only when its head equals the
#      worktree HEAD, or the worktree HEAD is an ancestor of the run head
#      (pipeline fix commits advanced the run on the same line of history);
#      local work that advanced past the run head, or diverged from it,
#      invalidates attribution. While the pipeline owns the branch
#      (branch_sync.state=pipeline_owned), its own custody attribution also
#      binds ANY ACTIVE run - executing or parked - without head equality
#      (fm_nm_run_is_pipeline_owned_active in bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh), and that
#      route is deliberately OUTSIDE the daemon rule below: while the pipeline
#      holds custody its own attribution is the attribution, and second-guessing
#      it here is a change to a route this fix does not otherwise touch.
#      A parked run head whose commit object the task copy never fetched cannot
#      be verified locally; that row is recognized only as a provable
#      pipeline-owned continuation - the branch's ACTIVE newest ledger row,
#      anchored by the row immediately before it having ended at exactly this
#      worktree's head (rule owned by fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree in
#      bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh). The coarse runs-ledger fallback has NO
#      branch-name-only acceptance: an executing `axi status` record is the one
#      live bind, so a ledger row that cannot be tied to this worktree's head
#      never answers on branch name alone. A record whose daemon has ANSWERED
#      down reads unknown and names the dead instrument on exactly ONE route:
#      the id-addressed selected run whose head this copy cannot resolve and
#      whose continuation the ledger anchor proves. The coarse ledger fallback
#      carries NO such verdict - it reports the same status word for a
#      head-matching row and an anchored one, so any rule there would also catch
#      head-tied rows, and a record whose head still equals or precedes the
#      worktree HEAD keeps its original working reading, as it always has.
#      A record whose
#      identity is proven by NEITHER head nor ledger anchor is not this
#      worktree's run to report on: it leaves HAVE_RUN=0 so the pane and status
#      log answer, because a stale record naming this branch must never override
#      a crew that is visibly working.
#      A run PARKED at a gate is exempt from the dead-instrument verdict: an
#      open decision stays open when the instrument dies, so it keeps its gate
#      and findings.
#      fm_nm_select_run in bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh owns complete run selection
#      and ambiguity reporting. The selected run's id-addressed status must
#      agree on id, branch, and live/terminal class before attribution;
#      disagreement reports unknown with available candidate ids.
#      The run-step is AUTHORITATIVE: running/fixing -> working, ci -> working
#      (the id-addressed detail read carries step words the overview does not),
#      awaiting_approval/fix_review -> parked (with gate findings), terminal
#      passed/checks-passed/passed-with-override/passed-with-skips -> done,
#      failed/cancelled -> failed. passed-with-override is a passing outcome
#      carrying an explicitly approved Test or CI exception (no-mistakes' own
#      vocabulary), read identically to a clean passed. passed-with-skips is
#      also a passing outcome (publication or CI verification was
#      automatically skipped, no-mistakes' own vocabulary), read as done but
#      with that skip kept visible in the detail, unlike a clean passed.
#      EXCEPT: while
#      the active step is ci, `axi status` alone cannot tell "still waiting on
#      checks" from "checks green, waiting on merge" (see nm_ci_checks_state) -
#      a check of the full ci-step log overrides working -> done once checks read
#      green, so a green PR is never silently read as still-validating. And a
#      terminal FAILED run whose only failure is the ci monitor step, after
#      every substantive step completed and the ci log's last marker reads
#      checks green, also reads done (held-for-merge), never failed: a monitor
#      whose only remaining job is to observe a human merge decision must not
#      convert the absence of that decision into a failure verdict
#      (nm_failed_run_is_green_held_ci; 2026-09-05 jr-voice incident). In the
#      coarse runs-ledger fallback (no steps table, no ci log), a terminal
#      FAILED record whose daemon an explicit probe proves down reads unknown,
#      never failed: an instrument failure must not read as work failure
#      (nm_daemon_probe_down).
#   3. Reconcile the status log through fm-classify-lib.sh's status_current_line:
#      open decisions survive unrelated events and continuation prose cannot
#      hide a declaration. Ship/scout terminal declarations supersede stale log
#      decisions. If it says needs-decision/blocked but
#      the run-step shows the run moved on, the log is deterministically stale and
#      is flagged superseded. A genuinely parked run plus a needs-decision log
#      agree, and are reported as parked. A `blocked:` line that reports a
#      refused or missing daemon socket remains blocked even if an attributed
#      run record is stale or terminal, for as long as that blocker is still the
#      log's latest event. The same holds for any open decision when the run
#      record itself is UNVERIFIED (its daemon answered down): the crew saw its
#      gate or blocker first hand, so needs-decision stays parked and blocked
#      stays blocked, with the unverified record named as the reason.
#      Other daemon, timeout, or unreachability
#      claims are superseded BECAUSE THE RUN IS ALIVE when the run is
#      running/fixing with recent reported activity: a killed or timed-out drive
#      call is not daemon death, so that claim is answered by steering the crew
#      to reattach, not by escalating.
#   4. No current run for this crew (pre-validation, uninitialized repository,
#      proven historical head, or kind=scout): fall back to the recorded
#      backend's pane busy state, then the resolved status declaration
#      when its verb maps to a recognized run-state. Decision-only events such as
#      `resolved` never become current state or detail.
#   5. Missing meta or torn-down worktree: report unknown · none. If no run is
#      attributed to this crew, a dead endpoint also reports unknown · none rather
#      than trusting a stale status log. On tmux and herdr, which own a
#      recovery-grade classifier, only its positive death evidence reads as gone
#      (the endpoint is authoritatively absent, or its pane holds no agent); an
#      endpoint that merely failed to answer reports unknown · none as
#      unreachable, and an alive endpoint whose scrollback read failed is still
#      classified by step 4. Backends with no classifier keep reading a failed
#      capture as gone. The fallback's own comment owns the per-verdict rules.
#
# Read-only and side-effect free. Always exits 0 on a successful read regardless
# of state; exit 2 only on a usage error (no id).

# 0 when the gate's own findings table holds at least one row whose `action`
# column is exactly `ask-user` - the pipeline's own record that this gate's
# answer is owed by a HUMAN, not by the crewmate (the gate's shape -
# awaiting_approval, fix_review, awaiting_agent - is reported parked in every
# case and does not by itself say who owes the answer; only a findings row whose
# `action` column is exactly `ask-user` does).
#
# Read POSITIONALLY, the way nm_gate_step_row above reads its row: locate the
# `findings[N]{...}` header, take the index of the `action` column from it, walk
# each of the N rows that follow to that index, and compare for EQUALITY. A
# substring search over the run payload cannot make this distinction - the
# trailing `description` column is free text that routinely quotes finding
# actions, and the payload also carries the branch name and step names, so a
# gate owed the crewmate's own answer would match just as readily as one owed a
# human. Column order is read from the header rather than assumed, so a table
# that grows a column keeps answering correctly. Both the header match and the
# row scan require the BRACE, so the count, the index and the rows all come from
# the same block: an earlier unbraced `findings[N]:` line from a resolved round
# must not supply the rows while the braced gate table supplies the index, which
# would read the wrong block's rows at the right block's offset
# (tests/fm-crew-state.test.sh's unbraced-precursor case pins it).
#
# Reading the index out of the header and then walking RAW COMMAS to it is only
# positional in name: the walk is sound only while every column before `action`
# is comma-free, and the producer does not quote commas inside `description`
# (tests/fm-crew-state.test.sh's own fixture proves it). A header ordering that
# puts free text before `action` would therefore let a row's description mint
# the marker - silently, with no error - which is the same class of hole the
# positional derivation exists to close, arriving by a different route. So the
# columns preceding `action` are checked against a WHITELIST of names this table
# is known to carry as short comma-free scalars, and anything else refuses:
# a whitelist rather than a blacklist of free-text names, because an unknown
# column must read as unsafe rather than as safe. When the table's shape is not
# provably safe the correct answer is the noisy one - a crewmate that went quiet
# before answering its own gate is the failure that must never be silenced.
# Residual bound, which no unquoted positional parse of this table escapes: a
# comma inside a whitelisted field's own value (a path with a comma in it, say)
# still shifts the walk.

# monitoring until merged or closed", or, for a repository whose default-branch

# so the last match is current): green with nothing red after it means CI is
# green right now, still only waiting on merge/close.
# "base branch advanced (..), re-arming CI monitor timeout" is deliberately NOT
# a marker: the monitor logs a checks state only when that state changes, and a

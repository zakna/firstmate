# Record a PR-ready task: store one validated canonical pr=<url> and the forge's
# exact pr_head=<sha> when available, then atomically arm a static merge poll.
# Refuses when bin/fm-dod-lib.sh will not accept the named head as reachable
# outside the worker's disposable copy; in no-mistakes mode a forge-reported
# head is that named head and is already stored on the forge.
# The watcher check source is byte-for-byte bin/fm-pr-poll.sh; task and PR data
# live only in a private sidecar and are never interpolated into shell source.
# A GitHub pull request URL, a GitLab merge request URL, and a Gerrit change URL
# are all accepted, including a merge request or change on a self-hosted
# instance.
# A GitHub pull request the forge reports as a draft is refused, naming the draft
# state and recording and arming nothing: a draft cannot be merged, so a poll armed on it
# would wait for an event that cannot occur while nobody is asked to act.
# Mark the pull request ready for review, then arm again; a lane that keeps a
# draft on purpose declares a wait instead of reporting done. An unreadable
# draft state does not refuse, matching how the head read below is optional.
# bin/fm-pr-merge.sh records through this script with FM_PR_CHECK_MERGE=1 and
# skips this refusal, because its own merge-time draft refusal is authoritative.
# When it records a GitHub pr_head, it also counts the inline review comments
# whose commit_id is that exact head, from any author, and prints "review
# comments: <n> inline on head <sha>". An unreadable count prints "unknown"; it
# never refuses arming.
# Usage: fm-pr-check.sh <task-id> <pr-url>

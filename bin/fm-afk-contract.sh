# fm-afk-contract.sh - the one owner of the away-posture record: its schema, the
# captain's away words recorded verbatim, the read-back rendering, the entry
# announcement, and the archive at return.
#
# POSTURE. Away mode is a posture of the one supervision session, recorded in
# state/.afk-contract and never inferred from chat. While the record exists the
# home is afk; the captain's first unmarked message archives it (the return path
# in bin/fm-afk-return.sh calls `archive` through bin/fm-afk-launch.sh stop).
# Being away changes how the captain is informed and what happens at a
# captain-owned decision point, never the authority set. Hold-for-return is the
# only reach profile this release records: there is no phone channel, and the
# entry announcement says so every time.
#
# ENTRY IS THE GO. `/afk` itself is the captain's go: after the `/afk` skill
# stows open work and asks for any compaction, `enter` writes the record in
# the same turn and never waits for a further human response, because the
# captain who typed /afk may not look at the screen again.
# The read-back is printed after the record exists; it is informational, never a
# gate, and never asks for a go.
#
# THE RECORD IS THE WORDS. The captain's away words are the whole mandate: they
# are recorded verbatim, read back as plain sentences by firstmate after entry,
# and acted on by the supervision session's own judgment at the
# moment an event makes them relevant, through the guarded scripts and under the
# standing authority it already has (bin/fm-branch-prompt.sh "Postures" owns the
# execution rules). NO PARSER, TOKENIZER, CLASSIFIER, OR GRAMMAR READS THE WORDS
# HERE, BY THE CAPTAIN'S MANDATE: this script never tokenizes, classifies, or
# semantically validates them, records no clause fields, ids, or verbs, and keeps
# no per-task merge-grant list. What stays mechanical is exactly what a script can
# check without reading words: a merge green at its live head under this record's
# lock, synchronous merges only, the spend cap, and the never-set.
# HARD RULE: destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive actions are never
# pre-authorizable whatever the words say.
#
# RECORD (state/.afk-contract; written only by this script; YAML-shaped so a
# human can read it, but parsed only here - consumers use the read subcommands):
#   version: 2
#   entered: <UTC ISO 8601>
#   entered_epoch: <seconds>
#   expected_return: <UTC ISO 8601> | -
#   reach_channels: none
#   reach_announced: <the one-sentence reach announcement>
#   spend_max_concurrent_workers: <n>
#   confirmed: <UTC ISO 8601>       when this mandate was recorded; /afk itself
#   confirmed_epoch: <seconds>        is the go, so no later human step stamps it
#   words: | or |-                 the captain's words, verbatim, never edited,
#     <line>                       one record line per input line (or `words: -`
#     ...                          when /afk carried no words); `|` retains a
#                                  final newline and `|-` records its absence
# The words block runs to the end of a version 2 record; in a version 1 record
# only its legacy clauses:, refused:, and merge_grants: sections end it. Any
# other line after the header that is not a stored line is damage, not a
# boundary, so a truncated mandate can never read as a whole one.
# A version 1 record (the retired clause model) still validates and reads: its
# scalar fields and words are read exactly as above, and its clauses:, refused:,
# and merge_grants: sections are ignored, so an upgrade never breaks a live away
# window. Only version 2 is ever written.
# The retired two-step entry staged a proposal at state/.afk-contract.proposed;
# no proposal is written any more, and `enter` removes one an older version left
# behind. Archived final records live under state/afk-contracts/ as
# <entered_epoch>.afk-contract, and replaced mandates use
# <entered_epoch>-superseded-<confirmed_epoch>.afk-contract.
# A replacement carries the original session entry forward. Durable
# archive-chain identity and same-second session identity are deferred, with no
# owner: no incident motivates them.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-afk-contract.sh enter [--words-file <path> | --words <text>]
#       [--expected-return <UTC ISO 8601>] [--spend <n>]
#     Write the record now, with no separate confirmation step, then print the
#     entry announcement and the read-back. Exit 0 on success and 2 on a usage
#     error. --words-file keeps the file's bytes verbatim, trailing newlines
#     included. With no words while a record stands, this is a refresh that
#     leaves the standing record untouched; new words replace the mandate,
#     carry the original session entry forward, and archive the superseded
#     record. A replacement is staged before the prior record is archived and
#     replaced. `propose` and `confirm` were retired with the wait-for-go gate.
#   fm-afk-contract.sh readback
#     The record's content for the captain and for the away session: the words
#     verbatim plus the entry time, expected return, spend cap, and reach line.
#   fm-afk-contract.sh field <name> [--path <record>]
#   fm-afk-contract.sh words [--path <record>]
#   fm-afk-contract.sh validate [--path <record>]  exit 0 when the record is readable and complete
#   fm-afk-contract.sh archive              move the record aside; print its path
#   fm-afk-contract.sh archived <entered_epoch>   print that archived record's path
#
# CROSS-SUBSYSTEM LOCK (state/.afk-contract.lock; this script is its one owner).
# This record is authority another subsystem reads and then ACTS on outside this
# script: bin/fm-pr-merge.sh reads the record's presence as away merge authority
# and afterwards hands a merge to the forge. A publication, replacement, or
# archive landing between that read and the forge handoff would land a merge on
# authority that no longer holds, so the two subsystems share one lock instead of
# each locking its own records: the record-mutating subcommands (enter,
# archive) hold it across their mutation, and a reader that acts on the record
# holds it across both its read and that action (fm_afk_contract_lock_hold /
# fm_afk_contract_lock_release). The read-only subcommands never take it, so a
# holder can still read the record it locked. Neither side ever proceeds without
# it: the acquire is bounded, and a bound that is hit refuses and names the live
# holder rather than racing. That fixed bound is 120 seconds, sized so only a
# genuinely wedged holder trips it. A lock left by a killed process is reclaimed
# by the ordinary stale-owner recovery in bin/fm-wake-lib.sh, which owns the lock
# primitive itself.
#
# Sourceable: with the BASH_SOURCE guard, other scripts get the path, presence,
# and lock helpers (fm_afk_contract_path, fm_afk_contract_present,
# fm_afk_contract_archive_dir,
# fm_afk_contract_lock_hold, fm_afk_contract_lock_release) without running main.

# Strip AI co-author trailers from a commit message, and
# install that strip as a per-task git commit-msg hook for a fleet launch.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-git-strip-ai-trailers.sh <msgfile>
#       Commit-msg hook mode. Git passes the proposed message file as $1.
#       Rewrites that file in place, then exits 0 so the commit proceeds.
#   fm-git-strip-ai-trailers.sh install <hooks-dir> <worktree>
#       Recreate <hooks-dir> as a core.hooksPath for this launch: a commit-msg
#       hook that runs this strip, plus one wrapper per client-side hook name
#       git documents except reference-transaction and post-index-change,
#       which are deliberately excluded (see FM_GIT_CLIENT_HOOKS below).
#       Each wrapper unsets GIT_CONFIG_* and then resolves
#       core.hooksPath (or $GIT_DIR/hooks) in the repository git is actually
#       running in, so a husky directory that only appears after npm install
#       still runs, and git -C some-other-repo does not inherit the task
#       worktree's hooks. That lookup also ignores GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS,
#       because git -c core.hooksPath=<this dir> (or a child process that
#       inherits it) carries the override there, and a lookup that honored it
#       would find this directory again and never run the repository's own
#       hook - a skipped pre-push guard. A lookup that fails exits nonzero
#       rather than skipping the repository's hook. Does not touch the
#       project's git config; the caller prefixes the pane with
#       GIT_CONFIG_COUNT / GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0 / GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Claude launches already carry attribution-off in their
# per-launch --settings JSON. Cursor and other non-Claude runtimes inject a
# Co-Authored-By trailer at the tooling layer AFTER the worker types a clean
# message, so the typed message is not the commit object.
# A prior per-machine ~/.cursor/cli-config.json attribution-off is not durable:
# it does not travel with Firstmate, it defaults back to on when unset, and it
# only feeds the CLI's request to the server - the trailer text is emitted by
# the model, so the setting suppresses rather than prevents it. Verified live
# on cursor-agent 2026.09.15 with attribution on: the trailer is already in
# .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG when the commit-msg hook runs, so the spawn-owned hook is
# the layer that sees the assembled message before the commit object is written.
# Human Co-Authored-By trailers are left untouched. Author identity is not
# rewritten.
#
# ACCEPTED RESIDUAL, ruled 2026-09-17. git commit --no-verify skips every hook,
# so a worker that passes it still lands the trailer, as would a runtime that
# writes the commit object without running git. Both incidents that motivated
# this strip came through an ordinary hook-running commit, so the ruling is to
# accept that gap rather than add a push-side rewrite or a push-side check. A
# trailer found on a fleet commit therefore points at one of those two paths,
# not at an unnoticed hole in the matcher.
#
# ACCEPTED RESIDUAL, ruled 2026-09-17. Inside a fleet pane git reports this
# directory as the repository's hooks directory, so a hook manager run there
# (lefthook's npm postinstall, pre-commit install) targets it and would
# displace the strip. install leaves the directory and every hook in it
# read-only, so such a manager fails loudly instead of silently winning. Hook
# managers therefore cannot install from inside fleet panes until a registered
# project genuinely needs it. Whoever removes the directory restores the owner
# write bit first.

# Client-side hook names git invokes by name from core.hooksPath, per
# githooks(5) in git 2.50. The receive-side names, the config-invoked
# fsmonitor-watchman, and the git-p4 names are left out because git never looks
# them up in a fleet worker's own worktree. commit-msg is written separately
# because it is the one that carries the strip.
#
# reference-transaction and post-index-change are deliberately excluded, ruled
# 2026-09-17. git invokes them twice per updated ref and on every index write,
# so a wrapper for either turns a stat git used to skip into hundreds of forks
# on one bulk command. Measured on git 2.50.1: a fetch of 300 new refs goes
# 0.23s -> 24.6s, and a no-op /bin/sh hook still costs 4.9s, so the price is
# git's invocation rather than the wrapper body. Neither name is one
# commit-message or lint tooling installs, which is what this chaining exists
# to preserve. A project that does install one loses chaining for it inside
# fleet panes only.
#
# The names kept are not free either, and that cost is accepted, ruled
# 2026-09-17. Every wrapper call forks bash plus one git rev-parse. A plain
# commit fires four wrappers, and git's sequencer fires prepare-commit-msg and
# post-commit once per replayed commit in rebase and cherry-pick, as git am does
# its applypatch hooks per patch. Measured on git 2.50.1 with no project hooks:
# one commit goes ~76ms -> ~276ms, and a 60-commit rebase 0.74s -> 3.7s. They
# stay because git-lfs installs post-commit, post-checkout, post-merge and
# pre-push, and a slower rebase inside a pane is the accepted price.

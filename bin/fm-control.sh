# fm-control.sh - the CONTROL PLANE for a firstmate-owned agent: allowlisted
# lifecycle verbs addressed to an exact task id.
#
# Usage: fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> exit [--stop-background]
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> relaunch [--harness <name>] [--model <name>]
#                                         [--effort <level>] [--stop-background]
#                                         (--note <text> | --note-file <path>)
#
# Why this exists, and how it differs from fm-send.sh. bin/fm-send.sh is the
# DATA plane: conversational text for the agent to read, always routing-marked
# for a kind=secondmate target so the reply returns through the status path.
# That marking is right for a message and wrong for a lifecycle command - a
# marked "/quit" arrives as ordinary chat the agent reasons ABOUT instead of
# executing. This script is the control plane: semantic process control with a
# closed verb list, per-harness mechanics owned by an executable adapter
# (bin/fm-control-lib.sh) rather than improvised in agent prose, and a verified
# postcondition for every action. There is deliberately NO arbitrary-text and
# NO generic raw-key entry point here; fm-send remains the only way to send an
# agent something to read.
#
#   interrupt  Deliver the harness's verified interrupt sequence. The agent
#              keeps running. Postcondition: delivery succeeded, the endpoint
#              still exists, and the agent is still alive where the backend can
#              classify that. Cancellation is confirmed only from an adapter-
#              owned acknowledgement and otherwise reported unconfirmed. Busy
#              state is never rewritten as proof of the action. Devin
#              cancellation invalidates it to unknown because its native hooks
#              emit no cancellation close; this is not a success claim.
#              An adapter whose repeated interrupt key does something else on
#              an idle agent (Devin's revert picker) sends its later presses
#              only after the first press rendered a running turn, and
#              otherwise reports `cancel=not-running` having sent one press.
#   exit       Stop the agent, preserving its terminal endpoint, worktree, and
#              every uncommitted change. Interrupts first when the task reads
#              busy, then submits the harness's exit command. Postcondition:
#              the backend's recovery-grade classifier reports the agent gone.
#              Already-stopped is success (idempotent). When the exit command
#              opens the harness's exit dialog instead (Claude's "Background
#              work is running", fm_control_exit_dialog_signal), exit REFUSES:
#              it chooses Stay, the agent keeps running, and the error names
#              the background work that would stop. --stop-background is the
#              caller's confirmation that this work is disposable; only then
#              is the dialog's "Exit and stop tasks" option confirmed. The
#              submit sends no further Enter once that dialog can be on
#              screen, so a retried Enter can never confirm it unasked.
#              An endpoint that reads
#              `missing` is put through the control plane's per-backend absence
#              proof (fm_control_endpoint_absence_verdict) before anything is
#              claimed about it, because `missing` also covers an endpoint that
#              is merely unreachable from this seat. That proof exists only on
#              HERDR, whose reads are scoped to the session the record names:
#              proven gone reports `endpoint-gone` rather than
#              `already-stopped`, because the endpoint this verb normally
#              preserves did not survive; a pane that turns out to be there and
#              idle is the ordinary `already-stopped`; one whose agent is back
#              takes the ordinary interrupt-then-exit path. A tmux `missing`
#              always REFUSES: a task record carries no socket identity for its
#              endpoint, so this verb cannot tell a destroyed window from one on
#              a tmux server it cannot address, and it will not claim a stop it
#              cannot see.
#   relaunch   Transactionally replace the running agent with a new one, in the
#              SAME worktree - and the same endpoint whenever that endpoint
#              still exists - on the same or a newly chosen
#              harness/model/effort - so switching harness is one ordinary use
#              of this verb. When the recorded endpoint is instead proven gone -
#              a Herdr pane or workspace destroyed in churn - the launch owner
#              re-creates one in that worktree, in the herdr session the record
#              names, and the task's record rebinds to it; that is how a task
#              whose terminal was destroyed is reclaimed by the home that owns
#              it, rather than being stranded with a parked approval nobody can
#              answer. Reclaim is HERDR-ONLY for the reason `exit` gives above:
#              a tmux `missing` cannot be proven absent from a task record, so
#              it refuses.
#              An explicit `default` model or effort clears that
#              axis for the replacement. With no explicit axis, a secondmate
#              re-resolves its durable config/secondmate-harness pin (harness
#              plus its optional model and effort tokens) exactly as any other
#              respawn does, while a ship or scout keeps the exact adapter
#              already recorded for it.
#              A prefixed raw-command basename cannot reconstruct its launch
#              command, so relaunch requires an explicit --harness for it.
#              A replacement Claude or Pi profile must also pass this home's
#              worker account pin (bin/fm-worker-account-lib.sh) here, so a pin
#              that no longer resolves or is signed out refuses before the old
#              agent stops.
#              --note is required for a ship or scout, whose replacement
#              inherits the local copy but none of the conversation; a
#              secondmate reconciles its own home's records at startup, so its
#              standing charter is never rewritten.
#              Records a durable checkpoint and that note, exits the old agent,
#              then delegates the launch to its single owner,
#              bin/fm-spawn.sh --relaunch. A failure before publication keeps
#              the prior durable record in place and reports the concrete
#              state; it never leaves a half-transitioned task claiming to be
#              running.
#
# Teardown and discard are NOT verbs here and never will be. `exit` stops an
# agent and preserves everything else; removing a worktree, killing an
# endpoint, or discarding work stays with bin/fm-teardown.sh, which owns the
# landed-work test.
#
# `resume` is not a verb: it is not deterministic across the verified adapters
# (bin/fm-control-lib.sh's header owns that reasoning). `relaunch` covers the
# same need for every adapter because the brief on disk, not a harness-private
# session, is the durable instruction.
#
# Targeting is EXACT: only a bare task id with a state/<id>.meta record in
# THIS home is accepted, and the record must pass the shared endpoint-identity
# validation (bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_validate_task_endpoint). A legacy
# fm-<id> label, an explicit session:window endpoint, and a bare window name
# are all refused - a lifecycle command delivered to the wrong endpoint is far
# worse than a loud refusal.
#
# A remotely placed secondmate is refused by name: its agent runs on another
# host, so no postcondition this plane verifies could be read for it here.
#
# Fail-closed boundaries:
#   - An unverified harness, or a harness whose control mechanics are unknown,
#     is refused rather than guessed at.
#   - A backend that cannot deliver the harness's interrupt key is refused
#     (Orca's terminal API has no Escape).
#   - `exit` and `relaunch` require a backend with a recovery-grade agent-state
#     classifier (tmux, herdr), because without one the "the agent stopped"
#     postcondition cannot be proven. zellij, orca, and cmux are refused rather
#     than reported as successful blind.
#   - An ambiguous or unreadable endpoint state refuses; only a positively
#     classified state acts.
#   - A composer that visibly holds pending text refuses before an exit command
#     is typed, so existing text is preserved instead of being concatenated.
#
# Environment knobs (all bounded waits, seconds):
#   FM_CONTROL_POLL              poll interval for postcondition waits (0.5)
#   FM_CONTROL_SETTLE_WAIT       adapter acknowledgement wait after interrupt (5)

#                                after the press gap (1.5)

#   FM_CONTROL_LAUNCH_WAIT       dead->alive wait after a relaunch (90)

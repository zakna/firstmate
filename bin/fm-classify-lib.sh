# Shared wake classifier: the common source of truth for captain-relevant status
# tests, declared-external-wait vocabulary, and the working/paused absorb
# classification that makes no-verb signal and stale-pane wakes safe to absorb.
# Sourced by BOTH the always-on watcher
# (bin/fm-watch.sh) and the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) so the
# overlapping triage policy lives in one place instead of two copies that can
# drift apart.
#
# Most functions are pure, side-effect-free reads of status files: each takes
# what it needs as arguments and touches no globals beyond the optional
# FM_CAPTAIN_RE override. Consumers layer their own dedup/marker state on top (the
# daemon keeps its escalation-digest seen-markers; the watcher keeps its .seen-*
# signatures).
# Status-span classification captures one file endpoint and reports every
# actionable event through that endpoint before the endpoint may be committed.
# An absent status file is a successful empty span, while an existing status
# object that cannot be read or identified is a classification failure with no
# committable endpoint.
# A presentation marker independently stores the last reported file signature
# and the last successfully classified position.
# Successful classification advances both facts through the captured endpoint;
# after a failure is reported, only the reported signature advances, so the same
# observed state alarms once while every unclassified byte remains for recovery.
# The reported signature includes path type, mode, symlink target, and observable
# failure kind, so a readability change is a new state that triggers another read.
# A missing, malformed, identity-mismatched, or past-end classified position reads
# from byte 0, preferring a bounded duplicate over a lost event.
#
# There are four documented exceptions. The absorb classification
# (crew_absorb_class and its working/paused wrappers) is NOT a pure status-file
# read: it reuses bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which may make a bounded no-mistakes call,
# to decide whether a crew that just stopped its turn or went stale is working,
# deliberately paused, or neither. Callers run it ONLY on no-verb signal handling
# and first sighting of a stale hash, never on every wake, so the per-wake triage
# stays cheap. status_open_decisions_incremental (see "incremental (cursor-backed)
# open-decisions fold" below) also writes: it persists a per-status-file byte
# cursor and folded open-set as a side effect, so a per-drain fleet-wide scan
# stays bounded by new appends instead of re-reading each task's whole lifetime
# log every time. status_home_appends_record writes the per-task home-owned
# append ledger (see "home-owned status-append ledger" below) so the wake scan
# can treat this home's own bookkeeping bytes as already owned.
# crew_worktree_written_since reads the task's meta file and walks a bounded slice
# of its worktree instead of a status file, so callers run it only at the moment
# they would otherwise escalate.

#
# Free-text tokens (PR ready, checks green, ready in branch, merged) exist only for

# verb-aware: a nonterminal working: or paused: line never becomes captain-relevant
# merely because its prose contains one of those tokens (for example
# "working: rebased onto merged #76").
# A declaration whose prefix is not one of those verbs is still an event, shown
# as the line itself. That covers an unknown word such as parked: or holding:,
# and a known verb whose correlation token is missing or mismatched, so the
# declaration cannot disappear behind an earlier recognized line. Continuation
# prose is not a prefix and stays off that path. Recognized verbs keep the
# classification below.

# they do not identify a separate classification or liveness source.
# bin/fm-brief.sh owns worker-facing declaration and resolution instructions.
# Unlike `blocked:` (stuck, firstmate must help), an idle `paused:` pane is EXPECTED, so
# the stale path bounds repeats instead of escalating a possible wedge; a live
# idle worker can still surface a first-sight stale alert. It is
# deliberately NOT in the captain-relevant set above: a pause is a "stop
# wedge-nagging this idle pane" signal, not work to keep surfacing. This constant
# is the ONE definition of the verb; both the watcher and the daemon read it here

# default: a declared wait is by definition expected to clear on its own, so a
# recheck is a backstop, not progress, and an hourly one only produced nagging
# (the 2026-09-07 away-window audit). A worker that knows when its wait clears
# names it with `until` (status_paused_until below) and is rechecked at that
# time or this cadence bound, whichever comes first. Both consumers read

# --- durable keyed decisions ------------------------------------------------
#
# The status stream is an append-only EVENT log. Reading it last-event-wins
# (last_status_line above) cannot represent "an earlier decision is still open
# after a later, unrelated event": a subsequent done/paused/working line silently
# masks a still-open needs-decision. status_open_decisions is the ONE authoritative
# statement of the status-fold contract that fixes this - a needs-decision/blocked
# line OPENS a keyed decision, and an explicit resolution or a verified
# captain-held backlog transfer referencing that key CLOSES it.
# Ship/scout terminal declarations supersede stale log decisions; a secondmate's
# terminal event may describe other work and cannot close an unrelated decision.
# Who WRITES the closing line is owned elsewhere: the answering firstmate closes
# at answer time through fm-send's --resolve-key (bin/fm-send.sh header), and a
# worker self-closes only a blocker that cleared without an answer (bin/fm-brief.sh
# rule 6), so closure never depends on a busy worker's discipline.
#
# Decision key grammar (backward-compatible with the existing "<verb>: <note>"
# format): an OPTIONAL "[key=<slug>]" token names the decision. Its documented
# position sits between the verb and the colon, and a complete token at the
# head of the note is accepted as an EQUIVALENT position, because that
# misplaced-colon shape is common real worker output whose stated key must
# never silently collapse into the shared "default" bucket (issue #2109):
#   needs-decision [key=api-shape]: <summary>
#   needs-decision: [key=api-shape] <summary>
#   resolved       [key=api-shape]: <how it was decided>
# Both positions state the same key and yield the same note (a consumed
# note-head token is key metadata, stripped from the note); when both positions
# carry a token, the documented before-colon one wins and the note-head token
# stays note text. A token deeper inside the note is prose, never a stated key,
# so a summary merely MENTIONING "[key=x]" cannot open or close that decision.
# A line with no token in either position uses the key "default", preserving
# the historical one-open-decision-per-task behavior (a bare "resolved:" closes
# "default"). A stated key whose slug fails the charset below is rejected (the
# folds skip the line), never rewritten to "default".
# The parsers are pure reads of a single line. Status metadata may contain any
# number of "[name=value]" tags before the colon, in any order, so verb parsing
# ends at the first tag rather than special-casing "[key=...]".
#
# Correlation tokens. That bracket rule already covers every BRACKETED tag,
# including the "[corr=<16 hex>]" form bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh writes. It
# does not cover the UNBRACKETED token that bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh writes
# (fm_pending_reply_corr_token), which a secondmate answering a marked request
# echoes on its parent status line ahead of the key tag (bin/fm-brief.sh), so a
# real transition routinely arrives as
#   needs-decision corr=<16 hex> [key=texte-du-mur]: <summary>
#   resolved       corr=<16 hex> [key=texte-du-mur]: <how it was decided>
# and a recovery turn can leave two such tokens on one line. All of those must
# read as the bare verb, in BOTH directions: a verb parse that keeps the token
# glued on matches no arm of _fm_decision_fold_line, so the opener never opens
# and the closer never closes, and a captain decision goes silently missing.
# Recognition starts only AFTER the retained leading verb: a token-first line
# keeps that token, so its following word cannot impersonate a transition and
# close a decision the captain is owed.
#
# The token grammar is OWNED by bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh
# (fm_pending_reply_corr_token, FM_PENDING_REPLY_CORR_RE). That library sources
# this one, so it cannot be sourced back here; the pattern below is a deliberate
# second statement of the SHAPE alone, and tests/fm-classify-corr-token.test.sh
# pins the two together through the real writers so they cannot drift.
#
# Recognition is deliberately narrow: EXACTLY the token that writer emits, whole
# word, and nothing else. An arbitrary "<name>=<value>" token is NOT skipped.
# Skipping unknown tokens would be the permissive road - it would let any
# free-text word carrying an equals sign ("resolved x=1 [key=k]: ...") reduce to
# a bare verb and impersonate a transition, which is the takeover the strict
# parse and _fm_decision_key_transition_allowed exist to prevent. Recognising
# only what a firstmate library actually writes costs one more line here each
# time a real new token shape is introduced, and that is the intended trade: a
# new shape is a deliberate, reviewed edit rather than a silent widening. A line
# whose token is malformed, wrong-length, or merely mentioned in prose keeps its
# extra words and therefore stays a non-transition, exactly as before.
#
# The 16 hex classes are written out literally rather than built from a
# variable, the same way bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh validates the id it is
# handed: a variable holding a glob is only re-read as a pattern under some
# shells' expansion rules, and a safety parse must not turn on that.

# block the owner's close - leaving a decision nothing will ever resolve - or
# clear the owner's decision with a bare resolution.

# The rule is deliberately generic, so this fold needs no knowledge of any
# particular owner: a reserved key may only be opened or closed by a line whose
# note speaks that namespace's own vocabulary, which its owner states by
# beginning the note with a `<namespace>...:` token. A line failing that is not a
# decision transition at all here and is folded as ordinary status. This is a

# --- incremental (cursor-backed) open-decisions fold ------------------------
#
# status_open_decisions above re-reads and re-folds a status file's ENTIRE
# lifetime on every call, so its cost grows with total log size. A per-drain
# fleet-wide scan using that whole-file function would pay that cost for every
# task on every wake, which grows unbounded as tasks run longer and accumulate
# status history. status_open_decisions_incremental and scan_open_decisions_incremental
# below are the bounded-cost siblings used for that per-drain path: each call
# reads only the bytes appended to a status file since its own last call (a
# persisted per-file byte cursor) and folds just those new lines into a
# persisted running open-set, via the exact same _fm_decision_fold_line rule
# status_open_decisions uses - so the two strategies can never disagree on what
# is open. Cost is bounded by NEW appends since the last drain, not by the
# status file's total lifetime size.
#
# Correctness invariant (unchanged from the whole-file fold): cursor advancement,
# age, and being buried under later appends never drop an open decision - the
# persisted open-set carries every still-open key forward across calls regardless
# of how much new unrelated log content has since been folded in. Only a line the
# shared fold rule retires removes one.
#
# The cursor format is `version` (FM_OPEN_DECISIONS_FOLD_VERSION plus the task
# kind, as `<n>:<kind>`), `offset`, `ident`, then the folded open set.
# FM_OPEN_DECISIONS_FOLD_VERSION must be bumped whenever
# _fm_decision_fold_line semantics change, so persisted state from an older
# interpretation is discarded and rebuilt from byte 0; the kind suffix does the
# same when a task kind changes, because kind changes the fold below.
#
# Cursor invalidation is deliberately minimal, matching how status files are
# ACTUALLY used in this repo: every one is created once (`>`) and only ever
# appended to (`>>`) - never replaced, renamed, or rewritten in place. So the
# ways a cursor can go stale are a fold-version mismatch, a shrink (truncated),
# or the file at this path being a different file than before
# (replaced/rotated/recreated), which a changed device+inode makes an O(1) check
# via a single `stat` call - no content hashing, no re-reading the consumed
# prefix. Any signal falls back to a full re-fold of the whole current file from
# byte 0 - byte for byte what status_open_decisions itself would compute - and
# rewrites the cursor from that clean baseline. A same-inode, same-size,
# in-place byte edit is NOT detected; that is a deliberately accepted gap
# because no code path in this repo ever does that to a status file.
#
# The other real failure mode is OUR OWN read failing (a stat/wc/tail I/O
# error), not a malformed writer: every such read here is checked, and on
# failure this reports the already-trusted persisted set unchanged rather than
# risking a silent invalidation that would wipe it - never a bare "empty" as if
# nothing were open.
#
# Not a pure status-file read: this writes/rewrites the sibling cursor file as a
# side effect (state/.<task>.open-decisions-cursor), the library's second
# documented exception to the pure-read rule after crew_absorb_class. The write
# is atomic (temp file + rename), so a crash between calls leaves either the
# prior cursor or the new one, never a partial one. bin/fm-wake-drain.sh calls
# this only after releasing the wake-queue lock, so a hypothetical race between
# two overlapping drains can at worst redo a little folding work twice - never
# drop an open decision - because a losing writer's offset can only ever be
# equal to or behind an already-recorded byte position, and the next call
# re-derives from whatever offset actually landed on disk.

# 4: verb parsing ends at the first "[name=value]" tag rather than only at a
# "[key=...]" one, so lines carrying another bracketed tag first became opens
# and closes.
# 5: status_line_verb now also reads through an UNBRACKETED correlation token,
# so lines that previously folded as ordinary status become opens and closes.
# 6: a done/failed line on a ship or scout closes every open decision, and the
# persisted version now carries the task kind, so cursors folded without that
# terminal rule are discarded.
# 7: that terminal rule now fires only for a line carrying a colon, so a cursor
# folded when bare prose could close every open decision is discarded.
# 8: a colonless line without a complete "[key=...]" token is no longer a
# transition at all, so a cursor holding a phantom decision that bare prose
# opened - which no later line could close - is discarded.
# 9: the two colon tests read the line with its time tag stripped, so a
# malformed worker stamp whose colons used to pose as the head/note separator
# no longer opens or closes anything; cursors folded under that reading are
# discarded.
# Version 4 was already spent on the bracketed-tag parser change above, and a
# cursor persisted under that reading predates this one, so it must still be
# discarded and rebuilt from byte 0 under the new reading.

# --- unread status lines since the presentation cursor ----------------------
#
# The drain annotation historically printed only the newest status line, so a
# substantive `note:` answer immediately followed by a routine `note:` (or a
# pending-reply resolution buried under a later unrelated append) never reached
# the supervisor. Those verbs also never enter the OPEN DECISIONS fold, so they
# had no other surfacing path.
# These helpers are the ONE owner of "what is still unread since the last drain
# presentation": one fleet manifest records each status identity and last-
# presented byte offset, and one atomic replacement commits only the contiguous
# status spans that were successfully presented. A quiet fleet scan leaves
# routine working/done bytes unacknowledged so a subsequently published signal
# can still annotate them. A missing manifest row or changed file identity is
# offset 0 for the current file, while malformed or unreadable cursor state
# aborts presentation without advancing any offset. A trusted cursor at EOF
# prints nothing, so already-presented bytes are not replayed as new. Teardown
# retires a task's manifest row with its status file, so reusing a task ID starts
# the replacement log unread at byte 0. Informational `note:` lines and
# reserved-key pending-reply resolutions are the fleet-wide unread surface;
# they are not open decisions and are not persisted in the folded open-set.

# Read the legacy per-task open-decisions cursor used to seed the presentation
# offset before the fleet manifest exists. A fold-version mismatch, identity
# mismatch, or offset past the current size falls back to 0. Never writes unless
# a caller explicitly requests a migration snapshot.

# --- home-owned status-append ledger ----------------------------------------
#
# This home's bookkeeping closes (fm_wake_status_append_self_announced) record
# the exact byte range they appended so the wake scan can tell this home's own
# growth from a foreign write. That is the multi-answer path: two distinct
# --resolve-key closes must not each force a captain-facing wake solely because
# each one appended a status line, while a worker-authored line that is not in
# this ledger still signals.
# fm_wake_signal_seen_current (bin/fm-wake-lib.sh) is the ONLY consumer. The
# ledger decides whether growth wakes this home and nothing else: it never
# removes a line from presentation, so the drain's signal annotation and its
# UNREAD STATUS section both still print these bytes.
# The ledger does not use lag verbs to hide a worker `resolved` line; only
# bytes this home itself recorded as owned are ever treated as owned.
#
# Path: state/.<task>.home-appends
# Format:
#   v1
#   ident=<file-ident>
#   <start><TAB><end>
# Ranges are half-open [start, end), written in the order they were appended.
# The only writer is fm_wake_status_append_self_announced, which records the
# pre- and post-append size of an append-only log it just grew, so each new
# start is at or after the last recorded end; a new range that begins exactly
# where the last one ended extends that line instead of adding another.
# status_home_appends_covers depends on that ascending order: it walks the
# ledger once and ignores any range starting past the point it has reached, so
# a ledger written out of order would refuse to prove coverage and fail toward
# waking, never toward silence.
# An identity mismatch (file rotated) discards the ledger. Teardown deletes it.
# Not a pure status-file read: status_home_appends_record writes this sidecar.
# That read-merge-write serializes through bin/fm-wake-lib.sh's fm_lock_*
# helpers, exactly as status_retire_presentation_task above does, so a caller
# that touches this ledger must have sourced that library first.

# Capture the bytes of an append-only status log at or after <start-offset> under

# The record form produces `<endpoint>\t<identity>\t<events>` and returns 0 when
# the span has actionable events, joining every such event in source order with
# ` ; ` so callers report the complete captured span before committing it.
# With optional <record-var>, it assigns that record instead of printing it; with
# optional <needs-decision-var>, it also assigns 1 when the span newly surfaces a
# needs-decision, captain-held declaration, or pending-reply escalation, otherwise
# 0. This side-band classification never changes the event text.
# It returns 1 after a successful classification with no actionable event; an
# existing log still produces its committable endpoint and identity, while an absent
# log is the ordinary empty case and produces no record.
# It returns 2 with no committable endpoint when an existing status object cannot
# be classified.
# The simpler wrapper prints only the event field, and the predicate discards the
# record; all three inherit the library-header contract above.
#
# A keyed `needs-decision` or `blocked` opening is included only when the
# captured span's fold still names that exact opening as live.
# Earlier log lines cannot change whether an opening in the span survives:
# only later lines can close or supersede it. Folding only the span therefore
# gives the same verdict for its openings without rereading the log's history.
# A transition rejected by the reserved-key vocabulary is surfaced instead as a
# reconciliation signal and never treated here as an open decision.
# status_open_decisions remains the single owner of open/closed semantics,
# including same-key reopening and reserved-key handling.

# The excluded set is everything a supervisor read or a package manager can write
# without the crew doing any work - .git first, so firstmate's own read-only git
# commands against the worktree can never make the probe self-fulfilling - plus the
# large generated trees that would make the walk expensive. Both are overridable so
# a home with an unusual layout can widen or narrow the probe. The list is a skip
# list, so clearing it skips nothing and widens the walk to the whole depth-bounded
# tree; it never disables the probe, which would quietly cost the wedge detector a
# liveness input on a home that meant to widen it. Defaulted with the plain form so
# an explicitly empty value stays empty: clearing the knob in the environment is the
# documented way to ask for that wider walk, and treating empty as unset would hand
# the default skip list back to exactly the home that asked for more coverage.

# Wall-clock seconds the probe's single walk may take. The walk runs synchronously
# inside the caller's poll loop at the exact moment an escalation would otherwise
# fire, and -xdev keeps it out of a nested mount but cannot help when the worktree
# root ITSELF sits on a hung network or container mount; unbounded, such a walk
# would wedge the very supervisor that exists to notice a wedge, stalling its
# heartbeat instead of escalating. Hitting the bound is a negative outcome like
# every other: it reads as no evidence, so the caller's escalation schedule is
# untouched and a stall that writes nothing still escalates on the existing
# schedule. A value that is not a positive integer is not a bound at all (`timeout
# 0` and the perl fallback's `alarm 0` both disable the deadline), so the default
# applies instead; the check lives at the point of use so an in-process override
# gets it too.

# 0 when some regular file under <id>'s recorded worktree is newer than
# <anchor-file>: positive evidence the crew is still producing work even though its
# rendered pane has gone quiet. This is the third liveness input the wedge detector
# has, after pane quietness and the run step, and it exists because neither of
# those can see a crew that is writing source, then tests, then documentation
# behind a static pane - the 2026-08-14 case of eight consecutive possible-wedge
# escalations against a crew that was demonstrably working the whole time.
#
# 1 for every other outcome, including an id with no recorded worktree, a worktree
# that is gone, a missing anchor, and a walk that fails or finds nothing. Absence of
# evidence therefore always leaves the caller's existing escalation schedule
# untouched, so a crew that writes nothing still escalates exactly as before.
#
# A kind=secondmate task records a provisioned firstmate home, not a code tree, and
# such a home runs its OWN supervision inside it: its state/ directory churns a
# watcher beacon, pane hashes, and heartbeats whether or not the mate is producing
# anything, so a walk there would report liveness for a mate that has done nothing.
# Those homes are excluded outright rather than by pruning "state", which would also
# hide a legitimate source directory of that name in an ordinary worktree. The
# exclusion is a negative outcome like any other, so an unproductive mate keeps
# escalating on the caller's unchanged schedule.
#
# The anchor is the caller's own idle-window timer file, whose mtime already marks
# when the quiet window opened, so `-newer` needs no clock arithmetic, no temp
# file, and no portable mtime-setting. Not a pure status-file read (see the header):
# one pruned, depth-bounded, wall-clock-bounded walk per call, which callers must
# reach only when they are otherwise about to escalate, never on every poll. A walk
# that outlives FM_WORKTREE_WRITE_TIMEOUT is killed and reported as no evidence, so
# a hung mount costs the escalation nothing but the bound. -xdev holds that walk to the
# worktree's own filesystem rather than descending into a nested network or container
# mount, so a write that lands only under such a mount is one more negative outcome.

# 0 (benign/absorb) if EVERY task referenced by a no-verb "signal:" wake is provably
# working; 1 (actionable/surface) if any is not, or no task can be resolved. Pass the
# same space-separated file list the caller classified with the span read above.
# Files are mapped to task ids by stripping the .status / .turn-ended suffix;
# a no-verb wake with nothing
# provably working must surface, so an empty/unresolvable list returns 1.
# A kind=secondmate task's .status stream doubles as its routed-reply channel,
# so the lines new since the watcher's classified position are read before any
# busy evidence counts: a decision, blocker, terminal outcome, `note:`, any line
# carrying a correlation marker (fm_pending_reply_corr_token, bracketed or not),
# and any verb this library does not know is parent-directed content the
# supervisor must read, so it surfaces regardless of how busy the mate is. Only
# unmarked routine `working:` and `paused:` progress falls through
# to the same provably-working absorb an ordinary crewmate gets, so a healthy
# mate's progress no longer wakes the primary on every append while an unproven
# mate still surfaces. The span starts at the classified position its owner
# reports (fm_wake_signal_seen_size, bin/fm-wake-lib.sh, loaded by every watcher
# caller); a caller without that library reads the whole log, which can only
# surface more. An unreadable span surfaces. Scoped to .status files - a mate's
# bare turn-ended ping always used the ordinary provably-working absorb.

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-lease-lib.sh - the per-task supervision lease contract (one owner).
#
# WHY. A supervision branch (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md) is a second LLM
# actor beside MAIN (the captain's chat) in one firstmate home - on Pi, a
# persistent conversation inside the same pi process; beside another primary,
# a headless engine session run by the supervision host
# (docs/supervision-host.md) - and nothing in this contract assumes the two
# actors share a process. Most records have exactly one natural owner, but the
# overlap set - steering or stopping a worker, post-landing cleanup, backlog
# status for a task, stuck-worker recovery - could otherwise be mutated by both
# actors at once. The lease is the
# merge-conflict analog: a small per-task file saying which actor is changing
# that task right now, and the mutating entrypoints refuse the other actor
# while it exists.
#
# CONTRACT.
#   - Lease file: $STATE/.lease-<task>, one line "<actor>\t<pid>\t<epoch>".
#     Written atomically (temp + ln for claim, temp + mv for a same-actor
#     refresh), with inspection and mutation serialized by the home-local
#     lease-command lock; leases never coordinate across firstmate homes.
#   - Actors: exactly "main" and "branch". The current actor is
#     $FM_SUPERVISION_ACTOR when set, else "main". The branch's shell gets
#     FM_SUPERVISION_ACTOR=branch injected deterministically by the process
#     hosting it (on Pi, the branch extension's bash tool; elsewhere, the
#     supervision host's engine environment), not by agent memory. Any other
#     value is refused loudly - an unknown actor is a wiring bug, not a third
#     role.
#   - Staleness: the recorded pid is the long-lived supervising process (the
#     session-lock holder, or FM_LEASE_HOLDER_PID - see bin/fm-lease.sh), so a
#     dead recorded pid means the supervising session died; the lease is
#     cleared at the next claim, guard, or sweep. Liveness is the pure record
#     test, identical in every calling context: the recorded pid is alive and
#     IS the current state/.lock holder. So a lease left by an exited session
#     goes stale for every reader, whichever harness now owns the home, and an
#     unmarked main honors a live branch lease exactly as a Pi main does. The
#     one residual is a recorded pid recycled onto the next session-lock holder
#     itself; the host that owns a branch conversation releases that actor's
#     leases when it activates a new one (the Pi branch extension's
#     generation-activation cleanup; the supervision host also releases them
#     after every engine turn), which also recovers a lease held by the live
#     session but an abandoned branch conversation.
#
# THREAT MODEL (deliberate, captain-decided): these guards are
# CONFUSED-AGENT-GRADE, the same grade bin/fm-gate-refuse-lib.sh documents
# for the gate refusal. They stop non-deliberate misuse - the injected actor
# identity, the loud refusals, and the session-bound staleness make every
# accidental cross-actor mutation fail loudly. A deliberately forging shell
# running as the same uid inside the same pi process can evade any in-process
# discriminator (it can rewrite env, spawn fresh shells, and edit state
# files), so adversarial-grade separation is explicitly out of scope here and
# tracked as separate follow-up design work. The branch's shell prelude makes
# the actor variables readonly (see the Pi branch extension), so an
# ACCIDENTAL override fails loudly inside the branch's own shell as well.
#   - Guard semantics (fm_lease_guard): no lease, a same-actor lease, or a
#     provably stale lease passes; a live lease held by the OTHER actor
#     refuses with exit FM_LEASE_REFUSE_EXIT. Whenever the guard engages - a
#     supervision context (Pi, or an explicit actor), a home opted into the
#     supervision host (config/supervision-host, whose host can claim a task
#     that has no lease yet), or any lease file for the task - it retains the
#     lease-command lock until fm_lease_guard_release, so the other actor
#     cannot claim between the check and the guarded mutation, including the
#     first claim of a task no one has leased. An unmarked caller in any other
#     home with no lease file for the task returns before taking any lock, so a
#     home that never runs a branch is unchanged byte for byte.
#   - Role partition (fm_lease_forbid_branch): actions MAIN alone owns -
#     merging a PR, landing local-only work, spawning workers, answering a
#     decision, retiring a secondmate - refuse the branch actor outright,
#     lease or no lease, while the home is attended. While a confirmed,
#     readable, live away-posture
#     record exists (bin/fm-afk-contract.sh validate; docs/pi-supervision-
#     branch.md "Postures"), main is parked and its STANDING authority
#     relocates to the branch for exactly the actions whose guarded script
#     opts in with --away-relocated: a PR merge, a fresh spawn of queued work,
#     and a decision answer. Each guarded script keeps its own mechanical gate;
#     bin/fm-branch-prompt.sh "Postures" owns how the branch judges the
#     captain's away words before invoking one. The
#     relocation grants nothing beyond what main could do attended: it only
#     changes which actor may reach the guarded script's own gate. An action
#     that has no record-side gate of its own - landing local-only work or
#     retiring a secondmate - is never relocated and keeps refusing the branch
#     in both postures. An archived, absent, unconfirmed, or unreadable record
#     is absence: the
#     attended refusal, byte for byte. The record is validated immediately
#     before the guarded script's first persistent side effect and the lock is
#     not held across the operation, so a return's archive is never blocked by
#     a long spawn; a spawn or answer that completes seconds after archive is
#     standing-authority work the captain had queued anyway (accepted,
#     confused-agent-grade, like the merge residuals fm-pr-merge.sh documents).
#   - "backlog" is a reserved claimable resource name used by the branch
#     prompt around its own data/backlog.md writes. This is deliberately
#     branch-side containment only; main's tasks-axi path has no executable
#     backlog lease guard in this scope.

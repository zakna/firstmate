# fm-control-lib.sh - the ONE executable owner of firstmate's agent lifecycle
# CONTROL-PLANE mechanics.
#
# Data plane vs control plane (captain-approved root architecture, 2026-07-13).
# bin/fm-send.sh is the DATA plane: conversational text for the agent to read,
# always routing-marked for a kind=secondmate target so the reply comes back
# through the status path. That marking is exactly right for a message and
# exactly wrong for a lifecycle command: a marked "/quit" arrives as ordinary
# chat ("[fm-from-firstmate] /quit") that the agent reasons ABOUT instead of
# executing. bin/fm-control.sh is the CONTROL plane: allowlisted lifecycle
# verbs addressed to an exact task id, with the per-harness mechanics owned
# here rather than improvised per harness in agent prose.
#
# This file owns three capability tables plus their pure artifact-path tables,
# and ONE named exception to that purity - fm_control_endpoint_absence_verdict,
# the single owner of the per-backend endpoint-absence proof, which does run
# backend reads. Everything else has no side effects, runs no backend command,
# and reads no state, so sourcing this file is still free and the tables can be
# read by a test as a pure contract:
#
#   1. Verb allowlist. There is no arbitrary-text and no generic raw-key entry
#      point on the control plane; a caller either names an allowlisted verb or
#      is refused.
#   2. Per-harness control mechanics: which key interrupts a running turn, how
#      many times it must be sent, whether the composer needs clearing after
#      that key, which adapter-owned cancellation acknowledgement is observable,
#      which command exits the agent, and which task kinds the adapter is
#      verified to run. These are the empirically verified facts previously
#      carried only in the harness-adapters skill's per-adapter tables; that
#      skill now points here so one executable owner holds them, and
#      bin/fm-send.sh's --key path reads the same table rather than a second
#      copy of it.
#   3. Per-backend capability: which named keys a runtime backend can deliver,
#      and whether the backend has a recovery-grade agent-state classifier
#      (bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_agent_state) able to PROVE that an agent
#      stopped. A verb whose postcondition cannot be proven on the recorded
#      backend is refused rather than performed blind.
#
# `resume` is deliberately NOT a verb: it is not deterministic across the
# verified adapters (docs/agent-control.md owns the per-adapter resume facts).
# `relaunch` uses the brief on disk rather than a harness-private session as
# its durable instruction. The relaunch-time exception is
# fm_control_relaunch_resume_flag below: a reference the endpoint's runtime
# bound as its status authority is returned to a replacement with that adapter.

# crew shape - a nested worktree shell under the pane's top shell - and Herdr
# then applies only reports carrying the session identity it bound. A
# replacement agent started fresh in that same pane reports a NEW session, so
# its state reports are ignored and the pane stays frozen at whatever the
# previous agent last reported: a working crewmate reads idle until its task

# unambiguously with ${raw%%$'\t'*} and ${raw#*$'\t'}. The reason is empty
# except on `unproven`, where it is the concrete sentence the caller's refusal
# message embeds. It is returned on stdout rather than set in a variable
# because every caller reads this through a command substitution, where an
# assignment made here could never reach them.
#
# The verdicts:
#   gone     - absence is PROVEN. There is no endpoint and therefore no agent.
#   dead     - the endpoint is there after all and holds no agent.
#   alive    - the endpoint is there and an agent is running in it.
#   unproven - neither could be established; the caller must refuse.
#
# fm_backend_agent_state's `missing` conflates "the endpoint was DESTROYED"
# with "the endpoint is UNREACHABLE from here right now". An unreachable
# endpoint can still hold a live agent on the task's worktree, so every caller
# that would act on absence - `exit` claiming the agent stopped, `relaunch`
# re-creating the endpoint - must come through here rather than trusting the
# raw verdict.
#
# Whether absence is provable AT ALL is a property of the backend, not of the
# reading:
#   herdr CAN prove it. Every read goes through fm_backend_herdr_cli, which
#     passes `--session <session>`, so the recheck starts and reads the session
#     the RECORD names, through that session's own socket. The answer is about
#     the task's endpoint and nothing else.
#   tmux CANNOT. `list-windows -a` describes only the server the CURRENT
#     process addresses (its TMUX_TMPDIR/socket), and a task's record does not
#     carry the endpoint's socket identity - so a different but running server
#     would answer "not anywhere" about a window it was never able to see.
#     There is no read available here that closes that gap, so tmux always
#     returns `unproven` and both verbs refuse. tmux is left exactly as
#     deadlocked as it was before this change - no worse - but deliberately.

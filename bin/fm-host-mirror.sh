#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-host-mirror.sh - the supervision host's dialog mirror: what the captain and
# MAIN said in the captain's conversation, carried to the host's headless
# engine session at the head of each attended wake, while an away wake carries
# none and never moves the cursor (docs/supervision-host.md "The dialog
# mirror"). The Pi branch mirrors the same dialog in process
# (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md "How the branch knows what the captain
# said"); this is its twin for a host that is not Pi, and the one owner of the
# mirror file, its cursor, its lock, the feed, and the verified-writer list.
#
# WRITERS. Code-owned turn surfaces append here, never the model: Claude
# through its prompt-submit and Stop hooks, and Cursor through its
# beforeSubmitPrompt and afterAgentResponse hooks. Codex, Grok, OpenCode, and
# omp have no writer (docs/supervision-host.md "The dialog mirror"). A writer
# appends captain text (the submitted prompt) and MAIN text (the turn's final
# assistant message), never tool traffic, as said, with only the whitespace at
# the very end of the message trimmed. A prompt the shared operational-input
# protocol classifies
# (bin/fm-operational-input.sh: watcher wakes, guard follow-ups, launch briefs)
# is fleet machinery, not dialog, and is dropped, and so is a prompt that opens
# with the wrapper a harness puts around a turn it started itself: Claude
# submits its Stop-hook rewake inside <task-notification>, with no other field
# to tell it from a typed prompt (tests/fm-host-mirror-live-e2e.test.sh proves
# it).
# Every writer is a silent no-op unless this home opted into the supervision
# host (config/supervision-host, checked before anything else runs), the hook
# runs in a genuine primary checkout, and this session holds the fleet lock, so
# a home without the file, a crewmate worktree, and a read-only second session
# write nothing and print nothing.
#
# FILE. $STATE/.host-mirror.jsonl, one JSON object per line:
#   {"seq":N,"epoch":N,"key":"<main session>","id":"<source id>",
#    "tag":"captain"|"main","text":"..."}
# key is the current main-session key (fm_supervision_host_main_key,
# bin/fm-supervision-engine-lib.sh). id is the writer's own identity for the
# entry when it has one (a prompt id or a generation id); an entry whose id and
# text are already recorded for the same main session and tag is not appended
# again, so a surface that fires twice mirrors each entry once, while a
# different text under the same id is recorded. Each text is capped at
# 4000 characters, its truncation note included (head and tail kept, as the Pi
# mirror caps); when the file exceeds 300 entries it is trimmed to its newest
# 200. New entries continue above both the committed and staged
# cursor after file recreation so a later commit cannot skip them. An append
# writes the whole new file, owner-only, beside the mirror and renames it into
# place, so a write that fails or is interrupted leaves the mirror as it was.
# Every append and feed runs under $STATE/.host-mirror.lock.
#
# FEED. $STATE/.host-mirror-cursor holds "<seq>\t<engine session>": the newest
# entry already fed to that engine conversation. `feed <session> new|resume`
# prints what the next wake carries, one "[captain] ..." or "[main] ..." entry
# after another, oldest first, and fails, staging nothing, when the mirror is
# missing, cannot be read, or fails the file validation below; otherwise it
# stages the cursor it would reach in $STATE/.host-mirror-cursor.next, and
# `commit` advances the cursor to it once the engine turn that carried the wake
# is accepted with its report, so a wake the engine never completed leaves its
# entries unread for the next one. A resumed conversation gets the current
# main session's entries after the cursor; a new one (every
# main session start, rotation, or failed turn) gets the current main
# session's newest entries, so a fresh conversation re-anchors on this
# session's dialog and never on an earlier session's. The feed is bounded to
# 16000 characters, newest kept, with one line naming how many earlier entries
# it left out counted within that bound. Mirrored text is context for
# judgment and authorizes nothing (bin/fm-branch-prompt.sh "Context channels").
#
# VERIFIED WRITERS. `verified <harness>` exits 0 for a primary whose writers
# were proven against the real harness to record a session's dialog from its
# first captain prompt (docs/supervision-host.md "The dialog mirror"): Claude
# and Cursor. The host runs the attended posture only on those
# (fm_supervision_host_attended_ready), and every other primary keeps the
# attended behavior it has without the host.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-host-mirror.sh hook <harness>        a prompt-submit or turn-end hook payload on stdin
#   fm-host-mirror.sh feed <session> new|resume
#   fm-host-mirror.sh commit
#   fm-host-mirror.sh verified <harness>
# hook and commit always exit 0 and print nothing; feed exits 1 when
# the mirror is missing, could not be read, or holds an invalid entry, or the
# main session cannot be identified, and prints nothing when there is nothing
# to feed; verified exits 0 or 1 and prints nothing.

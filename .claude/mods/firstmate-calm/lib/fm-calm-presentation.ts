// Firstmate Calm presentation policy for the Claude Code mod, kept free of the engine.
//
// This module owns the decisions ../hooks/register.ts applies through `$`: where the
// shared per-home Calm preference lives and how its value reads, which assistant text is
// a mid-turn working note, and which transcript rows Calm hides. It shares Pi Calm's
// broad presentation boundary: genuine user prompts, genuine agent responses, and
// working activity stay visible; tool rows, tool groups, classified working notes, and
// canonically classified operational user rows hide, including a record-backed doorbell
// once the caller has read the record it names. docs/calm.md owns the exact
// captain-facing contract and docs/configuration.md
// the persisted preference schema. Everything here is pure so tests run it under Node.

// Shared wake-dispatch handshake between the Pi watcher extension (the

//
// Contract: the watcher builds one offer per actionable wake and emits it on
// FM_BRANCH_DISPATCH_EVENT. A live, enabled branch extension calls accept()
// SYNCHRONOUSLY inside its handler (the event bus invokes handlers
// synchronously up to their first await), so after emit returns the watcher
// reads `accepted`: true means the branch owns handling the wake, and its
// settlement promise keeps the watcher outcome pending until handling finishes
// or rejects back to the watcher's consumption-acknowledged main path; false
// means no branch took it and the watcher delivers to main exactly as it did
// before the branch existed. Watcher-failure alarms are never offered - only
// main can repair the watcher cycle (fm_watch_arm_pi lives on main).
//
// Postures (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md "Postures"). The away-posture record
// state/.afk-contract (owner: bin/fm-afk-contract.sh) is the posture; it is
// read as a file at every routing decision, never inferred from chat. While
// it exists the branch takes EVERY actionable row - check rows, decision-owned
// rows, and heartbeat rows included - and main is offered nothing the branch
// can take. The two vetoes that describe a broken queue stay vetoes in both
// postures, and such a wake, like every watcher-failure alarm, still falls
// back to main exactly as attended, because only main can repair supervision
// itself; parking main is a cost measure, continuity is the safety property.

//
// A check-kind row - merge-confirmation polls, Relay mentions, credential/auth
// failures, and every other legitimately main-only class - never vetoes a scan
// in either mode. It is simply excluded from eligibleSeqs and left queued for
// main, which is woken for it on that check's own watcher cycle
// (fm-primary-pi-watch.ts forces every check-kind TRIGGER to main), so nothing
// starves by being left behind.
//
// A signal row marked "needs-decision:" by the watcher, a second-mate signal
// whose presented span owns a decision (spanIsDecisionOwned), or a stale row
// for a task with an open needs-decision or a current captain-held declaration
// gets the identical treatment: excluded from eligibleSeqs, never a scan veto,
// and forced to main on its own triggering close (fm-primary-pi-watch.ts's
// offerWakeToBranch). Heartbeat handling remains independent.
//
// That applies to a heartbeat review too, and it is the whole point: a
// heartbeat used to be deferred to main merely because some unrelated check
// row happened to be sitting unread, which put a routine fleet review in the
// captain's chat for a reason that had nothing to do with the fleet. A
// permanently main-owned row is not fleet context the branch is missing, so it
// no longer rides the heartbeat into main (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md
// "Heartbeat routing").
//
// The heartbeat's all-or-nothing contract is unchanged in what it actually
// guarantees: a heartbeat review takes EVERY branch-ownable unread row or none
// of them. An unresolvable signal/stale row (unmapped project) still vetoes the
// whole scan in both modes, because that is a data/metadata problem this
// function cannot safely reason past, not an ordinary main-only event. A row
// this repo's fm_wake_append could never have produced (an unknown kind, or a
// line that fails the structural tab-field check) also still vetoes the whole
// scan - that is queue corruption, not an everyday mixed queue.
//
// In the away posture (`afk`, the dispatcher's read of the away-posture
// record) the partition above collapses: main is parked, so check rows,
// decision-owned signal and stale rows, and heartbeat rows are all claimed by
// the branch on whatever wake finds them unread. The two vetoes that describe
// a broken queue rather than a routing choice - an unresolvable task-local row
// and a structurally invalid or unknown row - stay vetoes in both postures.

// owner, so a close reaches main off Pi exactly when it would on Pi.
//
// A check-kind close (merge-confirmation polls, Relay mentions,
// credential/auth failures, and every other legitimately main-only class -
// docs/pi-supervision-branch.md) is never routed to the branch while attended,
// even when other currently-unread rows are individually eligible: this
// watcher cycle's own triggering event stays on main, exactly as before
// scopeForUnreadWake stopped letting a co-present check row veto the whole
// scan. That relaxation is what lets an UNRELATED eligible signal/stale row
// still reach the branch on this cycle; it must never also let a check-kind
// trigger itself slip past main's delivery.
//
// A signal close containing a needs-decision status file, or a stale close for
// a captain-held task, gets the identical main-only treatment as a check-kind
// trigger. The cross-reference deliberately includes every unread decision
// row: until that row is read, a later signal or stale trigger for the same
// task stays on main. Other tasks and heartbeat handling remain independent.
//
// The away posture collapses that partition: every actionable row is
// branch-eligible and the trigger class no longer forces anything to main
// (scopeForUnreadWake owns the per-row rule).

# Behavior tests for the no-mistakes GATE-agent fleet-lifecycle refusal.
#
# A confused no-mistakes gate agent runs inside a firstmate checkout, adopts the
# captain identity from AGENTS.md, and reaches for fm-spawn/fm-send/fm-teardown.
# bin/fm-gate-refuse-lib.sh is the firstmate capability-removal half: sourced at
# the top of those three entrypoints and called before any fleet mutation, it
# fails closed on either of two independent signals:
#   1. NO_MISTAKES_GATE set in the environment (the marker no-mistakes stamps);
#   2. the current worktree's git-common-dir resolves under a no-mistakes gate
#      repo (.../.no-mistakes/repos/*.git) - the unspoofable backstop, which
#      still refuses even if the marker was tampered/unset.
# A normal firstmate session (real primary, real crew worktree) has NEITHER
# signal and is completely unaffected.
#
# The one authorized exception is a disposable LAB home: bin/fm-lab-home.sh
# stamps a marker file only on a fresh empty dir, and inside a gate context the
# refusal lets a lifecycle call proceed only when FM_HOME is a marked lab home
# used through its stock layout (any FM_*_OVERRIDE relocation stays refused).
# The helper legs below cover the admit/refuse contract; teardown additionally
# proves the admit end-to-end through a real entrypoint.
#
# Each entrypoint is exercised in three scenarios, isolating exactly ONE signal:
#   - env-marker refuse : neutral cwd + NO_MISTAKES_GATE set      -> exit 3, no mutation
#   - path-backstop refuse: gate-worktree cwd + marker UNSET      -> exit 3, no mutation
#   - no-regression      : neutral cwd + marker UNSET             -> succeeds, no gate error
# The marker is UNSET explicitly in the no-regression/backstop runs (env -u) and
# those runs stand in a controlled NON-gate repo, so the suite is hermetic even
# when it is itself executed inside the real no-mistakes gate (whose process has
# NO_MISTAKES_GATE=1 and a gate-worktree cwd).
#
# Finally, assert firstmate's TRACKED .no-mistakes.yaml parses and sets
# disable_project_settings: true (the trusted-only opt-out that neutralizes gate
# agents' project instructions on the no-mistakes side).

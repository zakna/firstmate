# tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh - the arm layer's cycle-close contract when the arm
# did not own the cycle.
#
# The watcher prints its one reason line to its OWN stdout, so only the arm that
# forked it ever reads that line. An arm that ATTACHED to an existing cycle holds
# no handle on it and can observe only a released lock, which is why a completely
# successful cycle used to be reported as
# "watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason" on every harness
# whose protocol reads that line. These are real-process tests: a real
# bin/fm-watch.sh holds the singleton, a real bin/fm-watch-arm.sh attaches to it,
# and a real status change drives a real wake through the watcher-bound delivery
# record and durable queue.

# A re-arm does real work before and during its first poll: it steals the dead
# watcher's lock, publishes and announces the downtime marker, then surfaces the
# recovery wake. That is a long run of short-lived processes, which a contended
# host - a changed-suite run beside three other suites - can slow far more than
# this suite's mostly sleeping poll loops. One re-arm measured about 2s idle, 5-7s
# beside three concurrent copies, and past the arm's default 10s confirmation
# deadline when the case was held to 15% of one CPU. These cases assert recovery,
# not a deadline, so under the CONTRIBUTING.md fixture-budget rule the arm gets an
# explicit confirmation budget with headroom, and each wait on it is an
# iteration-counted ceiling that outlasts that budget. A passing case returns as
# soon as the arm reports or exits, and a watcher that never surfaces its

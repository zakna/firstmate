# passed, a forwarded signal, the caller replaced rather than wrapped, and a
# refusal instead of an unbounded run when nothing on the host can enforce the
# bound. Most cases pin the perl watchdog, the preferred mechanism and the only
# one a stock macOS host has, under a PATH that holds no timeout variant; the

# Live Herdr submit-confirmation guard (live-harness-optin family).
#
# Herdr's native agent_status can stay idle for a whole landed Claude turn, and
# a busy-queued Enter can keep proven pending text visible. A stub cannot prove
# either signal. This guard launches real Claude Code in an isolated Herdr lab
# and requires fm_backend_herdr_send_text_submit to report empty for a landed
# idle steer. It then requires the same submit path to prove and submit a
# typed /exit slash command behind the command popup Claude renders below the
# composer (the fm-control exit breakage on 2.1.283) and verifies the agent
# actually exited. It fails naming the harness and version rather than
# degrading quietly.
#
# Run explicitly with FM_HERDR_SUBMIT_CONFIRM_LIVE=1 after a Herdr or Claude
# upgrade, and before trusting a refreshed docs/verification/runtime-backends.md
# "Herdr submit confirmation" entry.
# Every Herdr call, including adapter calls, is routed through bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh.
